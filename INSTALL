Installation instructions for WebMail 0.7.9
=============================================


I. Requirements
===============

For building/running JWebMail you need the following software:

- JDK 1.4 or greater (get it at http://java.sun.com)
- a mailserver for sending (SMTP) and receiving (IMAP) mails; by default, 
  JWebMail will use "localhost" for both
- a webapp capable servlet container (e.g. Apache Tomcat, preferably >= 4.1,
  http://jakarta.apache.org)

In the WebMail contrib/ directory of the source distribution, you can find a
number of libraries that are needed by WebMail. The required libraries will be
installed automatically during the build process.

II. Installation
================


There are two approaches to installing WebMail >= 0.7.7, both require the Tomcat
(or a similar Servlet API 2.[23] + WebApp compatible) server.


1. Installation of a pre-compiled WAR-file (Webapp ARchive)
2. Build and install from source

The first installation method is almost always the preferred choice. Building 
from source may be relevant to you if you need to do modifications to the
source.

1. Installation of a pre-compiled WAR-file
------------------------------------------

This installation method is very simple:

1. Drop the webmail.war-file in your webapp-home. Under Apache Tomcat, this
   is usually $CATALINA_HOME/webapps, but you might find it under different
   locations on your system.
2. chown www-data.www-data webmail.war, i.e. change the owner of the WAR-file
   to the WWW-User (the user under which Tomcat is running)
3. Restart Tomcat (or do any steps required by your servlet engine to deploy
   the WAR-file)

WebMail is then available by calling http://yourhost/webmail/index.jsp

Please don't forget to visit the administration interface first. You can access 
it by calling http://yourhost/webmail/admin.jsp



2. Build and install from source
--------------------------------

WebMail is compiled by using the Ant build-system. For the installation, you 
will need a running JDK 1.4 (or greater).

The following steps are required (for a quick-start):
1. Set your JAVA_HOME environment variable (to the directory where the JDK is
   installed)
2. If you do not have TOMCAT_HOME or CATALINA_HOME set, then change the
   build.sh script such that the SERVLET_CONTAINER is set properly
3. Run './build.sh install-tomcat' if you have Tomcat installed and
   './build.sh install-catalina' in case you have Catalina installed to
   compile and install WebMail in your webapp-home. Make sure you have
   write-permissions on that directory.
4. chown -R www-data.www-data the webmail/ directory in the WebApp-home

Please see build.xml for further possible targets that may be used.
