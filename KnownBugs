This is a list of known bugs in WebMail. Some of them are bugs that I cannot 
fix, because they are not directly in the WebMail code but in some third party
library or program:

Title: 
  WU-IMAP server doesn't show recent messages in the message list
WebMail part: 
  Message List, Folder overview
Description: 
  You get a certain count of "recent" (or "new") messages in the folder 
  overview, if you click on the message list for the folder these new 
  messages are not shown.
Explanation:
  -
Solution:
  The problem doesn't exist if you use the Cyrus IMAP server


Title:
  Cannot delete messages on a POP3-Server
WebMail part:
  Message List, Message View
Description:
  It is not possible to delete messages if you use a POP3 Server
Explanation:
  The limitation is not from WebMail, but a problem of the POP3-Provider
  used by the JavaMail API. POP3 was not thought for remote message management
  and thus the message deletion support does not fit into JavaMails ideas on
  how to handle folders.
Solution:
  Either use IMAP (preferred) or try different POP3-Providers for JavaMail.
  For the latter, simply replace the file pop3.jar by the new provider.
