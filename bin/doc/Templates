WebMail templates
=================

WebMail pages are assembled using templates in normal HTML with special tags that are 
enclosed in "<<" and ">>". The tag name is looked up in the current session's 
environment table and the tag replaced with the value found there.
WebMail uses the gnu.regexp package for this.
There is currently no list of all available tags, but those are the most common:

<<SESSION>>		The current session ID. Mainly used in URLs
<<VERSION>>             Version of WebMail
<<DATE>>                Current date in locale specific format
<<OS>>                  Name of the operating system
<<LOGIN>>               Login name of the user
<<EMAIL>>               EMail address of the user
<<SIGNATURE>>           Signature of the user
<<FULL NAME>>           Full name of the user
<<FOLDERS WELCOME>>	A list of folders for the welcome screen (include number of
                        messages, status, ...)
<<FOLDERS CONFIG>>      List of folders for the folder setup dialog
<<FOLDERS>>         	Standard <SELECT> style list of folders

See the method setEnv() in WebMailSession for more tags.
