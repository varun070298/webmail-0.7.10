Translating WebMail to new languages
====================================

WebMail comes with much localization support. Users may change easily between languages
that are available.

WebMail will automatically detect all installed languages.

There are two "ways" to translate WebMail. One for the source distribution and one for
the binary distribution.

1. The "make" way
-----------------
Here I will explain how to translate WebMail to a new language if you are using the
WebMail source and will compile it anyway

Prerequisite:
recode-3.6

Steps:
1. Change directory to src/net/wastl/webmail
1. Copy data/xml/en (or de) to data/xml/<your_language>.
2. Diretories under the new direcotry(ie, data/xml/<your_language>) are
   available UI themes for webmail users to choose. Translate all the XSL 
   files in your new directory. You may just pick a theme to translate.
3. Copy data/xml/resources_en.xml to data/xml/resources_<your_language>.xml 
   and translate it. Since it's Java ResourceBundle conformed resource file, 
   you may name it as data/xml/resources_<your_language>_<your_country>.xml 
   if needed.
4. Change directory to src/, and edit the makefile 
5. Find "LANGUAGES=" then add your language to the "LANGUAGES" variable.
6. Find "if [ "$$lang" = "zh" ];", copy the if block to add a new "else if" 
   block for you language. 
   Then change the block as "if [ "$$lang" = "<your_language"];", and 
   $(RECODE) <your_language_encoding>..UTF-8...
7. Find "$(INSTALL) -m 0644  $(PKGDIR)/data/xml/resource.dtd", below that
   line, copy the string "test -z ... .xml;" to add a new statement. Change
   it as "test -z... $(RECODE) <your_language_encoding>..UTF-8...".
8. Issue "make" to rebuild WebMail.


2. The "binary distribution" way
--------------------------------
That's what you can do if you only have the binary distribution of WebMail or don't
want to rebuild WebMail with make.

1. Create a directory where you will work on (e.g. /usr/local/src/webmail )
2. Change to that directory and unzip webmail/lib/templates/html-templates_en.zip
   there.
3. You now have a subdirectory called html-templates. Translate all html files therein
4. Generate a zipfile of the translated directory using
   "zip -q html-templates_yourlang.zip html-templates/ html-templates/images"
5. Copy the new ZIP-file back to the WebMail templates directory 
   (webmail/lib/templates)
6. Copy the file WebMailStringResources_en.properties in the templates-directory
   to WebMailStringResources_yourlang.properties and translate the Strings there


Regardless which way you take, please inform me if you have a new translation for
WebMail so that I may include it in the distribution or offer it for download on the
webpage.
