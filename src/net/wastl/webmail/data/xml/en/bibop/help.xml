	You may click on each folder (that can contain messages) to view a message list.
      </p>
      <note>If you don't see folders that you expected here, maybe they are hidden. Go to the folder setup to

    <helpdata>
      <p>
	In the <bold>Folder Setup</bold> you have to select whether you would like to change your mailbox settings 
	or configure folders within existing mailboxes.	
      </p>
      <p>
	<bold>Configuring Mailboxes:</bold> WebMail allows you to access several completely independent mailboxes 
	via IMAP or POP3. For each mailbox you will have to provide the mailhost, the protocol and the
	login information.
      </p>
      <p>
	<bold>Configuring Folders:</bold> Within mailboxes, there might be several folders (organized in a tree
	structure). This works with IMAP, but not with POP3 mailboxes. Here you can add or remove folders
	in the folder tree.

  <helptopic id="folder-setup-folders" title="Setting up Folders">
    <helpdata>
      <p>
	As mentioned before, a (IMAP) mailbox might have several folders. The folder setup screen 
	allows you to add or remove folders from each of your mailboxes. Folders are organized in a tree
	structure for each of your mailboxes and displayed on this screen. For each folder you have the 
	option to remove it or, if it is a folder that can contain other folders, to append a subfolder to it.
      </p>
      <warning>
	<p>Folders will be <bold>physically removed from your mailbox</bold> (together with all mail and 
	subfolders in them), <bold>not only from WebMail</bold>! This is a <bold>dangerous</bold> 
	option and you cannot undo this step!</p>
      </warning>
    </helpdata>
  </helptopic>
 
  <helptopic id="folder-setup-mailboxes" title="Setting up Mailboxes">
    <helpdata>
      <p>
	WebMail allows you to access several independent POP3/IMAP mailboxes within one interface. To configure
	this you can use the <bold>mailbox setup</bold>.	
      </p>
      <p>
	In the first part of the screen you have a list of your currently configured mailboxes. You can use
	the <bold>Remove</bold> link to remove a mailbox from WebMail.
      </p>
      <note>
	<p>In contrast to the folder setup, a mailbox will only be removed from WebMail if you click on 
	<bold>Remove</bold> here. You will still be able to access it from other email clients.</p>
      </note>
      <p>
	In the second part of the screen, you can add a new mailbox by supplying the necessary information
	(hostname, protocol, login and password for the mailbox - ask your administrator if you don't know
	what to do).
