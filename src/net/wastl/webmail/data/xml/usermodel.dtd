<!-- The WebMail usermodel consists of
   - the navigation data, which stores the current state of the WebMail main screen
   - the system data, the subtree which contains WebMail's system configuration, which the admin 
     may opt to display to the user
   - the userdata, representing "static" user information like name, login etc
   - the state, represented with some environment-like variables
   - optional messagelists for the different folders; These consist of messages (either header
     or header and body) and will be assembled if a user requests a message list for the first time
