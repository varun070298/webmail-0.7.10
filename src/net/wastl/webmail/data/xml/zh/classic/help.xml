      <p>
	You get an overview of all your mailboxes and the folders contained in each mailbox. 
	Each folder has a column where the number of total messages and the number of new messages are
	displayed. There might also be folders that cannot contain messages but only subfolders. 
	You may click on each folder (that can contain messages) to view a message list.
      </p>
      <note>If you don't see folders that you expected here, maybe they are hidden. Go to the folder setup to 
	make folders visible</note>

	In the message list, you get an overview of the messages in your folder. You will see the subject,
	the sender, the size of the message and some flags that are set on it ("new", "seen", 
	"answered", "mime").<br/>
	You can display a message by clicking on its subject.<br/>
	You have the option to select one more messages and perform some kind of action on it like setting
	some of the above flags or moving/copying to other folders.

  <helptopic id="showmessage" title="Displaying a Message">
    <helpdata>
      <p>
	The message display form consists of 3 parts: a header, a body and a footer.<br/>
	<p>
	  In the <em>header</em> you get some information provided by the message header: the sender, the
	  recepient(s), the subject, and the date.
	</p>
	<p>
	  In the <em>body</em> the message text is displayed. If there are attachments to the message, you
	  will be able to view them either inline (e.g. images or text) or download them from the server. 
	  The attachment information is displayed after the message text.
	</p>
	<p>
	  In the footer you have again the option to perform some actions on this message (move/copy to other
	  folders, set message flags).

      <p>
	In the compose form you can compose a new message. In the header, you have to fill out the receipient
	and the subject at least. In the large area below, you can enter your message.
      </p>

  </helptopic>
  <helptopic id="compose-attach" title="Attaching Files">
    <helpdata>
      <p>
	While you are composing a message, you can attach files from your local system. These will be sent 
	to the WebMail server and attached to your message (this may take some time, depending on your 
	Internet connection).
      </p>
      <p>
	The <em>attach screen</em> offers you to browse your harddisk to add a file if you hit the 
	<em>browse</em> button. After you have selected a file you can enter a description for it and
	finally click on <em>add new file</em> to add it to the message. There is a certain limit to the
	size of attachments. This may be configured by your system administrator.
      </p>
      <p>
	Already attached files will be displayed on the left section of the screen. To remove an attachment,
	select it in the list and hit the <em>Delete selected file(s)</em> button.

  <helptopic id="folder-setup" title="Folder Setup">

    <helpdata>
      <p>
	In the <em>Folder Setup</em> you have to select whether you would like to change your mailbox settings 
	or configure folders within existing mailboxes.	
      </p>
      <p>
	<em>Configuring Mailboxes</em>: WebMail allows you to access several completely independent mailboxes 
	via IMAP or POP3. For each mailbox you will have to provide the mailhost, the protocol and the
	login information.
      </p>
      <p>
	<em>Configuring Folders</em>: Within mailboxes, there might be several folders (organized in a tree
	structure). This works with IMAP, but not with POP3 mailboxes. Here you can add or remove folders
	in the folder tree.

  <helptopic id="folder-setup-folders" title="Setting up Folders">
    <helpdata>
      <p>
	As mentioned before, a (IMAP) mailbox might have several folders. The <em>folder setup screen</em> 
	allows you to add or remove folders from each of your mailboxes. Folders are organized in a tree
	structure for each of your mailboxes and displayed on this screen. For each folder you have the 
	option to remove it or, if it is a folder that can contain other folders, to append a subfolder to it.
      </p>
      <warning>
	Folders will be <strong>physically removed from your mailbox</strong> (together with all mail and 
	subfolders in them), <strong>not only from WebMail</strong>! This is a <strong>dangerous</strong> 
	option and you cannot undo this step!
      </warning>
    </helpdata>
  </helptopic>
  <helptopic id="folder-setup-mailboxes" title="Setting up Mailboxes">
    <helpdata>
      <p>
	WebMail allows you to access several independent POP3/IMAP mailboxes within one interface. To configure
	this you can use the <em>mailbox setup</em>.	
      </p>
      <p>
	In the first part of the screen you have a list of your currently configured mailboxes. You can use
	the <em>Remove</em> link to remove a mailbox from WebMail.
      </p>
      <note>
	In contrast to the folder setup, a mailbox will only be removed from WebMail if you click on 
	<em>Remove</em> here. You will still be able to access it from other email clients.
      </note>
      <p>
	In the second part of the screen, you can add a new mailbox by supplying the necessary information
	(hostname, protocol, login and password for the mailbox - ask your administrator if you don't know
	what to do).

	    do it here (ask your administrator). Please don't forget to enter the same password in both 
	    fields.</li>
	  <li><em>Messages per Page</em>: Change how many messages will be displayed in the message list 
	    (default: 20)</li>
	  <li><em>Show fancy stuff</em>: Display some "graphical enhancements" that are otherwise pretty 
	    useless, like smiley substitution, link highlighting, ...</li>
<!--	  <li><em>Filter JavaScript</em>: Try to recognize JavaScript in emails and filter it out so you 
	    don't have security problems (this should be enabled).</li> -->
	  <li><em>Autoexpunge folders</em>: Controls whether messages that carry the "deleted"-flag should 
	    be deleted automatically or manually.</li>
	  <li><em>Show attached images</em>: Show images that are attached to a message inline. Otherwise 
	    they will be displayed like any other attachment.</li>
	  <li><em>Set message flags</em>: Enable write mode on folders. If this is not set, you may not change 
	    anything on messages (flag, copy, move).</li>
	  <li><em>Break lines</em> and <em>max line length</em>: If and where to break lines in the compose and
	    show message screens.</li>
